[Challenge Workflow](https://www.dropbox.com/s/494buy5bp7qqyc9/Workflow.pdf?dl=0)

This project requires me to build a bowling game.
The project code is  written in Javascript.
I use jQuery, CSS3 and HTML5 for the front-end.

Please refer to the Workflow.pdf document to see how I plan and execute this project.
